# nlp-mental-health-classifier-emotional-diagnosis-nlp
This notebook presents a sentiment analysis project tailored to identifying potential mental health issues based on textual input. Using various NLP techniques and machine learning models, the goal is to detect patterns that could be associated with mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, or PTSD.

üîç Project Highlights
Dataset: Text data labeled with mental health categories.

Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization.

Feature Engineering: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and combined embeddings.

Models Used:

SVM

Random Forest

XGBoost

Adaboost

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA for reducing feature space while retaining key variance.

Evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy/F1 metrics.

Objective: To develop an interpretable and efficient classifier that flags textual signs of mental health struggles.
